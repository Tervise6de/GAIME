# PROJECT_STATE

Canonical current state. Update before ending every session. Keep it a
snapshot — detail belongs in the logs and in git history.

- **Current stage:** WINNER_DEVELOPMENT (loops 1-3 done: goal structure,
  onboarding, generated territories with fairness guarantees). Stages 1-5 complete. MORNING_REPORT.md is current.
- **Current concept:** C01 HIVEMIND — paint scent fields (LURE/FEAR/RALLY);
  thousands of autonomous ants respond; persuasion, never orders.
- **Fallback concept:** C02 STORMWARDEN (runnable at
  prototypes/stormwarden/; skill-gradient assumption VERIFIED on held-out
  seeds — see PLAYTEST_LOG).
- **Current implementation:** `game/` — winnable/losable "First Season"
  scenario + onboarding + economy + escalation; `game/dist/HIVEMIND.html`
  single-file distributable; two frozen prototypes; `tools/` verification
  harness (headless runner, bot matrix, UI click tests, single-file
  builder, gameplay recorder).
- **Active hypothesis:** humans can learn and enjoy the painting verb —
  scripted play proves the depth exists; human feel is the top unknown.
- **Last known good commit:** HEAD of main at end of overnight-1 (Loop 3;
  40/40 generated maps pass fairness checks; seed-7 commander regression
  WON t=175; dist verified from file://).
- **Current build status:** GREEN — RE-VERIFIED 2026-07-11 morning run:
  served game AND single-file dist both WIN seed 7 (commander), idle/naive
  lose distinctly, 60fps ~0.5 ms/tick, both prototypes serve, all media
  intact. See CLAUDE.md for the one-line re-verification command.
- **Highest-value next action:** (post-morning) generalized commander bot +
  cross-seed winnability/difficulty sweep; brood-throttle verb; art-direction
  spike. Human playtest of the single-file build is the gating experiment.
- **Blockers:** human playtesting cannot be done from this environment
  (founder action needed — see BACKLOG "Now" #5).
- **Morning report ready:** true — Stage 7 report re-verified and stamped on
  the 2026-07-11 morning run; build confirmed GREEN.
