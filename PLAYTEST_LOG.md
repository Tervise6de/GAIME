Append-only record of actual builds, runs and playtests. Newest at the

behaviour. Every entry names the commit it tested.

## 2026-07-10 ~20:10 UTC — HIVEMIND prototype, first falsification runs
- Hypothesis / what was tested: PRE-REGISTERED — "if SMART routing cannot
  beat NAIVE straight-line luring by >=1.25x food with <=0.6x deaths on the
  same seed, the painting verb is hollow." Scenario: guarded rich pile,
  two safe-but-distant piles, 2 spiders, seed 7, 120 sim-seconds, scripted
  strategies (naive / smart routing / warband composition).
- How it was run: headless Chromium via tools/run_proto.mjs, fast=10,
  deterministic seeded sim, results from window.__RESULTS.
- Observed result (facts): Run 1 (no brood economy): naive gross 900 food /
  4025 deaths; smart 391 / 83; warband (rally-kill-then-harvest) 900 / 36,
  spider killed. Pre-registered claim FAILED on throughput (smart gross
  0.43x naive) — free respawns made mass sacrifice viable, and long safe
  routes taxed round-trip time. Run 2 (brood costs food beyond initial
  reserves): naive ends stock 0, colony collapsed to 664; smart stock 0 but
  colony 2987 (income converted to population); warband stock 471, colony
  at cap 3200, 36 deaths. Perf: ~1.0 ms/sim-tick at 3200 agents (headless).
- Evidence class: VERIFIED FACT for all numbers (this scenario, this seed,
  scripted bots); CREATIVE JUDGMENT that the warband column *looks*
  dramatic (screenshot media/proto/hm_battle.png).
- Weaknesses found: (1) deaths must cost resources or meatgrinder play
  dominates — fixed in-run by brood economy, retained; (2) route length is
  a heavy hidden tax — good tradeoff material, needs surfacing to players;
  (3) spider territories are invisible to a human player; (4) lure has no
  long-range attraction — players must build roads, not point (this is the
  interesting part of the verb, but onboarding must teach it explicitly).
- Action taken: brood-cost economy kept; committed; comparison vs
  STORMWARDEN pending its build.
